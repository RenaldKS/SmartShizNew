<!-- 
    Thank you for your contribution! 🎉 

    Please make sure that you:

    - Use `git rebase` to bring your branch up to date, do not use a merge commit for that.

    - Do not add translations by editing the language variants of strings.xml as that 
      creates merge conflicts between Codeberg git repo and Weblate git repo,
      use Weblate https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/freeyourgadget/gadgetbridge/

    - Do not use `e.printStacktrace()`, use slf4j logger or `GB.toast` for logging
      as per https://gadgetbridge.org/internals/development/project-overview/#logging
    
    You can erase this comment from PR description, thank you!
